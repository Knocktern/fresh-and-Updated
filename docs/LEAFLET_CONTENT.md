## 📖 The Story

### The Problem We Solved

#### 🏢 The Recruiter's Nightmare (Employer Side)
*"Meet Karim — an HR Manager at a growing tech startup desperately looking for a React developer..."*

Karim posted a single job opening and received **500+ applications** in just one week. He spent 3 full days manually screening resumes, only to find that most candidates didn't even have the required skills. When he finally shortlisted 10 candidates:
- 4 didn't show up for interviews
- 3 failed basic technical questions
- The remaining 3 needed external tools (Zoom, HackerRank) to assess

**After 3 weeks and countless hours wasted, he still hadn't hired anyone.**

**The Recruiter's Pain Points:**
- ❌ Flooded with hundreds of unqualified applications
- ❌ No way to verify skills BEFORE the interview
- ❌ Scheduling interviews across time zones is chaos
- ❌ Using 5 different tools: LinkedIn, Email, Zoom, HackerRank, Google Docs
- ❌ No access to expert technical interviewers
- ❌ Can't track candidate progress efficiently

#### 👩‍💻 The Candidate's Struggle (Job Seeker Side)
*"Meet Rina — a fresh graduate with excellent coding skills but struggling to find her dream job..."*

Rina spent months applying to 50+ jobs manually, writing cover letters, and never hearing back. She didn't know if her skills matched job requirements. She had no idea where she stood in the hiring process.

**The Candidate's Pain Points:**
- ❌ Applies blindly without knowing if they're a good fit
- ❌ No feedback on applications
- ❌ Downloads multiple apps just for one interview
- ❌ Can't showcase actual coding skills
