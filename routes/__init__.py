# This file contains all remaining route blueprints that need to be extracted and organized
# Import all route modules to ensure they are registered with the app

# TODO: Create individual blueprint files for:
# - app/routes/employer.py
# - app/routes/admin.py  
# - app/routes/interviewer.py
# - app/routes/manager.py
# - app/routes/exam.py
# - app/routes/messaging.py
# - app/routes/notification.py
# - app/routes/interview.py

# For now, the main.py file will continue to work as is for these routes
# The priority routes (candidate, job browsing, authentication) have been refactored into blueprints
